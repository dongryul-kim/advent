# Advent of Code

The plan is to occasionally participate in
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to learn new programming languages.
I am not competitive enough to try and get on the leaderboard.

* 2023 - Rust

Languages to learn in the future (in alphabetical order):

* Go
* Haskell
* Lean
* OCaml
* Zig
